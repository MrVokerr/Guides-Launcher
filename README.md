## Customizing It Yourself

### Prerequisites (for building from source)

- **Python 3.7+**
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/)  
- Windows (tested on Windows 10/11)

### Installing

1. Clone or download this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUser/GuidesLauncher.git
   cd GuidesLauncher
   ```
2. Install the only Python dependency:
   ```bash
   pip install customtkinter
   ```

---

## Configuration

Your guide URLs live in **`config.json`**. By default we load the first game config (World of Warcraft ‚Äì Retail). Here‚Äôs the structure:

```json
{
  "configs": {
    "World of Warcraft (retail)": {
      "classes": {
        "Rogue": {
          "Assassination": [
            "https://www.wowhead.com/guide/classes/rogue/assassination/bis-gear#overall-bis",
            "https://murlok.io/rogue/assassination/m+#stats",
            "https://www.archon.gg/wow/builds/assassination/rogue/mythic-plus/‚Ä¶"
          ],
          "Outlaw": [
            "..."
          ],
          "Subtlety": [
            "..."
          ]
        }
        // ‚Ä¶ other classes & specs ‚Ä¶
      }
    }
    // you can add more games here if you like
  }
}
```

- To **add** or **update** links, just edit the arrays under each `class ‚Üí spec`.
- No trailing commas or comments‚Äîstandard JSON only.

## Usage

2. Pick your **Spec**.  
3. Click **Show Guides**.

## Building the EXE

We include a **`package.bat`** script that automates packaging:

1. Make sure **`Guides.py`**, **`config.json`**, and **`package.bat`** are all in the same folder.
2. Double-click **`package.bat`**.
3. It will:
   - Install PyInstaller if needed  
   - Clean up any old build files  
   - Produce `Guides.exe` in this folder  
4. Share the resulting `Guides.exe` with friends‚Äîno extra files needed!
